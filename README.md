Little description-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stencil ====> Stencil is a graphic design tool that’s focused on marketing, rather than making graphic design accessible. And beyond marketing, Stencil is specifically focused on social media images.

This “niching down” allows them to offer a hyper-focused tool, though you’ll also lose some flexibility when it comes to templates and stock photos.

The big draw of Stencil is that it’s designed to allow you to push out social media images as quickly as possible. And it’s also stupid simple to use.

Stencil has hundreds of templates, 1,200,00+ CC0 images, 800,000+ icons, 100,000+ quotes, and lots of other nifty features.

They have a free plan that lets you create 10 images per month. But if you really want to use it to boost your social media tools, you’ll need one of the paid plans starting at $9 per month.
Snappa ====> Like Canva and DesignBold (next on this list), Snappa is another all-purpose design tool that simplifies graphic design enough to make it accessible to an average person. Quickly create images based on set dimensions or pre-built templates. Then, edit and add effects as needed to create the perfect design.

Snappa offers up 200+ fonts and 3,000+ vectors and shapes to help you create some stunning designs. And what’s really nice is that you can schedule your images to post on social media without leaving the Snappa interface.

That’s definitely handy!

Like Canva and DesignBold (again!), Snappa also has a feature that lets you automatically resize images to convert between different dimensions.

Snappa has a free plan that allows 5 downloads per month. After that, you’ll need to go with the $10 per month pro plan.
Crello ====> Crello is a new’ish Canva alternative that a few different people shared in the comments. I haven’t used it as much as the others, but it seems to be quite flexible and have a good set of templates.

One neat feature is the ability to create animated content or even Instagram video stories.

In total, Crello supports 40 different formats.
 Canva =====> Canva is a simplified graphic-design tool website, founded in 2012. It uses a drag-and-drop format and provides access to over a million photographs, vectors, graphics, and fonts. It is used by non-designers as well as professionals. The tools can be used for both web and print media design and graphics.
